# String Theory meets Machine Learning

This repository is part of a lecture series given at Uppsala University, November 2020.
There are two directories, *latex* containing the presentation slides, and *notebooks* containing several jupyter notebooks.  
In total there are 4+1 lectures, split into one half theory and one half coding each.  
The goal of this series is to give participants hands on experience on how to utilize neural networks to tackle problems in string theory. We will reproduce results of a couple of recent papers and I'll also present some ongoing project(s) I'm currently working on.  
The interested reader will find exercises and some open questions after each coding session. Hopefully these will inspire some to further dive in and investigate this rather new subfield of string theory.

## Schedule

Thanks to all the participants. If you have further questions to any of the notebooks or slides, don't hesitate to contact me. The last lecture will be given as part of the Uppsala journal club and will not include a coding session.

## Literature

There are several nice reviews for machine learning from a (theoretical) physics perspective:

1. Fabian Ruehle - [Data science applications to string theory](https://inspirehep.net/literature/1779782)
2. Jared Kaplan - [Notes on Contemporary Machine Learning for Physicists](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/jared-kaplan/files/2019/04/ContemporaryMLforPhysicists.pdf)
3. Pankaj Mehta et al. - [A high-bias, low-variance introduction to Machine Learning for physicists](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.08823.pdf)

Proper machine learning books:

1. Christoper M. Bishop - [Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/pattern-recognition-machine-learning/)
2. Ian Goodfellow and Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville - [Deep Learning](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/)

## Seminars

There is an ongoing seminar series 'Physics meets ML' which can be found [here](http://physicsmeetsml.org/). Before Christmas there will be the fourth (?) edition of [string data](https://indico.cern.ch/event/958074/). Registration is still [open](https://indico.cern.ch/event/958074/registrations/64758/). Magdalena is going to talk about our [explore and exploit](https://github.com/robin-schneider/gymCICY) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.04817).
